#summary Feature plans and development timelines.

= Implemented =

The USB backend, based on libusb, is working, but it's still got a few hardcoded values that I would like to unbake.  The MIDI backends for ALSA, JACK and Core Audio will be done shortly.  Code will be in SVN very soon.

= Planned =

=== Guitar Hero: World Tour drum support ===

This requires hardware which I do not have.

=== LED Control ===

Depending on the speed of the "Ring of Light" controller, it may be possible to give it a MIDI channel and use it as a metronome or whatever.  In any case, it'd be nice to have it stop blinking incessantly.

=== Input remapping ===

The current version fixes drum events to MIDI events (in a sensible way, but still).  While it's possible to remap the instruments in most software, it's easier to remap the controller.

=== Velocity curves ===

I don't know if the default velocity curve is sensible, but in case it's not, this'll be here for you.

=== Windows? ===

Depends entirely on people letting me know they're interested.
