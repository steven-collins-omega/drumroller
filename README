PLEASE NOTE: I (steven-collins-omega) have not yet contributed to this project in any way as of this writing. None of this code is my work. I am simply interested in preserving this work as I may make use of it in a nascent project of mine. Consider this a fork of the original.

This code currently just decodes the ION Drum Rockers.  See:

http://code.google.com/p/drumroller/

for info.  Until next time, you can experiment by building it yourself.
Make sure libusb-0.1 is installed, then compile with

gcc -lusb usb.c -o drumroller-test

and run

./drumroller-test

to see some crappy output.
